LMA Member ObsUnitSet README
=============================
A brief description of the main actions, categories and files of the ALMA data at the Member Observing Unit Set (OUS) level.


HOW TO
======
* Get the FITS products:
     Download and untar the product/*001_of_001.tar file or download files individually from the 'product' category

* Check the quality or processing of the data:
     Download and untar the auxiliary/*auxiliary.tar or download the qa/*.qa2_report.pdf and qa/*.weblog.tgz individually
     from the 'auxiliary' category

* Create the calibrated Measurement Sets (MS):
     1) Download and untar the *auxiliary.tar and *asdm.tar files
     2) Install the latest CASA software (or for manually reduced data the CASA version specified in the QA2 report)
     3) Change into the 'script' subdirectory, and run 'casa --pipeline -c *scriptForPI.py' 

     A more detailed description of how to create the calibrated MS can be found in the 'Instructions' section
     of qa/*.qa2_report.pdf.


DATA CATEGORIES
===============
* auxiliary                             calibration tables, scripts, logs and quality assurance reports

* product                               FITS products for science targets and calibrators (potentially incomplete)

* raw                                   uncalibrated raw data that were used to make the final products

* raw (semipass)                        uncalibrated raw data that are flawed or incomplete and were not used

* external                              externally contributed data products (may be present in some cases)


FILES
=====
For a full description of the ALMA data products see https://almascience.org/processing/qa2-data-products.
Depending on the type of data or processing, not all of the following files may be present.
