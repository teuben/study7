pub_abstract                   We are just starting to understand the physical processes driving the dramatic change in cosmic star formation rate between z ̃ 2 and the present day. A quantity directly linked to star formation is the molecular gas density, which should be measured through independent methods to explore variations due to cosmic variance and systematic uncertainties. We use intervening CO absorption lines in the spectra of mm-bright background sources to provide a census of the molecular gas mass density of the Universe. The data used in this work are taken from ALMACAL, a wide and deep survey utilizing the ALMA calibrator archive. While we report multiple Galactic absorption lines and one intrinsic absorber, no extragalactic intervening molecular absorbers are detected. However, due to the large redshift path surveyed (∆z = 182), we provide constraints on the molecular column density distribution function beyond z ̃ 0. In addition, we probe column densities of N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) &gt; 10<SUP>16</SUP> atoms cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, 5 orders of magnitude lower than in previous studies. We use the cosmological hydrodynamical simulation IllustrisTNG to show that our upper limits of ρ (H_2)≲ 10^{8.3} M_{☉ } Mpc^{-3} at 0 &lt; z ≤ 1.7 already provide new constraints on current theoretical predictions of the cold molecular phase of the gas. These results are in agreement with recent CO emission-line surveys and are complementary to those studies. The combined constraints indicate that the present decrease of the cosmic star formation rate history is consistent with an increasing depletion of molecular gas in galaxies compared to z ̃ 2.

proposal_abstract              The Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is the only laboratory to study the low metallicity ISM at high spatial resolution, and yet we still do not know where the CO emission exists. We propose to use the ACA in standalone mode to map a 1.0 x 0.5 degree (1 kpc x 500 pc) region of the SW Bar of the SMC in 12CO, 13CO, C18O (2-1) covering a large fraction of the recent star formation, dust, and HI gas. With this new map we will be able to catalog CO clouds and clumps down to a mass of ~1000 solar masses and with a factor of ~15x increase in luminosity sensitivity over the existing large-scale single-dish APEX map. With only the ACA and the minimum integration time per pointing, we will produce a map of extragalactic CO with the greatest mass sensitivity and covering ~1.5 pc to 1 kpc scales. Once we have an accurate account of the CO-emitting gas we will be able to measure the CO luminosity function, the dynamical state, how CO brightness relates to environmental properties, and variations in X(CO). Further analysis of the data will allow us to understand the turbulence properties across all scales and how the CO emission relates to the HI gas at low metallicity.
